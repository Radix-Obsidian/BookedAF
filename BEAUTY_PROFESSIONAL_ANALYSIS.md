## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**Current Status**: Your app is **customer-focused only**. It's perfect for people booking salon appointments but **cannot support independent beauty professionals** managing their home-based businesses.

**To Support Home-Based Beauty Professionals, You Need**:
- ‚úÖ User role differentiation
- ‚úÖ Professional registration flow  
- ‚úÖ Service creation and management
- ‚úÖ Professional dashboard
- ‚úÖ Business profile management
- ‚úÖ Enhanced booking system for providers

**Estimated Development Time**: 8-12 weeks for full professional support

**Your current foundation is excellent** - the maps, booking system, and UI are perfect. You just need to **add the business/professional layer** on top of your existing customer experience.

**Recommendation**: Start with Phase 1 (role system) to validate the market, then expand based on professional user feedback! üè†üíÖ
